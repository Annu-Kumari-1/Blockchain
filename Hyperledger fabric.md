## Introduction

In general terms, a **blockchain** is an immutable transaction ledger, maintained within a distributed network of peer nodes. These nodes each maintain a copy of the ledger by applying transactions that have been validated by a consensus protocol. These transactions are grouped into blocks, each including a cryptographic hash that links it to the previous block, forming a secure chain.

As the popularity of blockchain platforms like **Bitcoin**, **Ethereum**, and other public (permissionless) blockchains grew, so did interest in applying blockchain's underlying technology—**distributed ledgers** and **smart contracts**—to enterprise-level applications. However, these enterprise use cases demand features and performance characteristics that permissionless blockchains often lack.

For example, enterprise applications often require:

- **Identifiable participants** — Essential for compliance with regulations such as **Know Your Customer (KYC)** and **Anti-Money Laundering (AML)**
- **Permissioned networks** — Only approved participants can join the network and perform actions
- **High throughput and performance** — To handle large volumes of transactions
- **Low latency** — Fast confirmation and finality of transactions
- **Confidentiality** — Protect sensitive business data and transactions

**Hyperledger Fabric** addresses these enterprise needs with a **modular and extensible architecture**.

## Key Features

- **Permissioned Network:** Only authorized members can access and interact with the blockchain.
- **Modular Design:** Pluggable consensus and membership service providers.
- **Smart Contracts ("Chaincode"):** Business logic is written in general-purpose languages like Go, Java, or Node.js.
- **Private Data Collections:** Supports data privacy and confidential transactions.
- **Channel-based Architecture:** Different subsets of network participants can form channels for private communication.
- **Identity Management:** Integrates with enterprise identity systems and supports X.509 certificates.

## Hyperledger Fabric Architecture

![Hyperledger Fabric Architecture](https://imgs.search.brave.com/j63HNsz539JtrvNvlMW9gD0hcJJ57ixDwDsa49KaC6M/rs:fit:860:0:0:0/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9zb2Z0/d2FyZW1pbGwuY29t/L2h5cGVybGVkZ2Vy/LWZhYnJpYy1jaGVh/dC1zaGVldC90b3Bv/bG9neS4yYzU2ZTE1/Yi5zdmc)

The architecture consists of several key components:

- **Peer Nodes:** Host ledgers and smart contracts (chaincode)
- **Ordering Service:** Orders transactions and ensures consistency across the network
- **Certificate Authority (CA):** Issues cryptographic certificates to identify network participants
- **Channels:** Provide a mechanism for private communication between certain network participants
- **Endorsement Policies:** Define which peers must validate a transaction before it is committed

---

## Basic Flow of a Transaction

1. **Client Application** submits a transaction proposal.
2. **Endorsing Peers** simulate the transaction and send back responses.
3. The **Client** collects endorsements and submits the transaction to the **Ordering Service**.
4. The **Ordering Service** packages transactions into blocks.
5. **Committing Peers** validate transactions and append them to the ledger.
